# Introduction

This project is designed to reduce latency in network environments using various reinforcement learning techniques.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. To run the main program, execute:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

## Demonstrating Environment Usage

The `display_env_usage` function in `env_handler.py` demonstrates how to use the `Environment_Handler` class. It initializes the environment and prints the energy consumption results.

To see this demonstration, simply run the main program as shown above. The output will include the energy consumption details and a confirmation message indicating that the environment was generated successfully.
